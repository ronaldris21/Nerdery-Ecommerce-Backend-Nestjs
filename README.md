## Use the app on the server:

App has been deployed to a personal VPS in Hostinger. In order to make sure the project is always running smothly, Uptime Robots has been configured as follow:
- App has 2 enpoints /hello and /db to check the backend health
- /hello makes sure the app is running
- /db makes sure the database connection is active
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/80fc97ef-b205-4eba-8c67-3fbf96d07ec5)


There are 2 apps on a server:

1. http://217.15.170.229:3100/api
2. http://217.15.170.229:3101/payment?clientSecret=pi_3Qbp0A062gksTdkE0hcMVVpL_secret_p9WJXmIEmJ8X8hhjgE9BK4wGl

All you need to have is Postman to test the app.

Variables used in POSTMAN: 

- HOST:
    - http://217.15.170.229:3100/api
    - [localhost:3100/api](http://217.15.170.229:3100/api)
- ACCESS_TOKEN

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f09e792-38ee-4dd8-99c1-c23b6cf95455)

Note: access_token is set automatically after login endpoint is successfully hit.

### POSTMAN TESTS
### Fork the POSTMAN requests from: [RonaldRis Public Workspace](https://www.postman.com/lively-meadow-246836/ronaldris-public-workspace)

- For testing purpose you can copy this postman. Here you have the postman used for testing the app. Make sure to have the environments active on you postman: 

[RonaldRis Public Workspace](https://www.postman.com/lively-meadow-246836/ronaldris-public-workspace)

- These are the requests used in the project

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb747d10-fe41-46ee-ae27-ec8963cb6e39)

- You can test them locally on POSTMAN DESKTOP  (to edit the requests make a fork)
